/* Vanya got n cubes. He decided to build a pyramid from them.
Vanya wants to build the pyramid as follows: the top level of the 
pyramid must consist of 1 cube, the second level must consist 
of 1+2=3 cubes, the third level must have 1+2+3=6 cubes, and so on. 
Thus, the i-th level of the pyramid must have 1+2+...+(i-1)+i cubes.

Vanya wants to know what is the maximum height of the pyramid that 
he can make using the given cubes.

Input
The first line contains integer n (1<=n<=104) â€” the number of cubes given to Vanya.

Output
Print the maximum possible height of the pyramid in the single line.
