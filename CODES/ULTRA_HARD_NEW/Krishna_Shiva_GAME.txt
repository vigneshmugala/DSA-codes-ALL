two friends Shiva and crisna playing a game they will take some numbers and the one who makes that number to 1 will win. 


They can only reduce numbers by following some rules. 
1) Check if the number is a power of 2. If it is a power of 2, the person divides the number by 2 
2) Else, the person subtracts the number by the highest power of 2 lower than the number. 
   Then the person gives the newly obtained number to their partner.

shiva starts the game every time

Input format
first line N , the starting number for the game
Since N can be a very large number, use appropriate data types for the variables.

Output format
print the person name who wins

input =6
output =Crisna
Explanation
     1) Shiva starts, 6 is not a power of 2.
     Hence, shiva subtracts 6 by the highest power of 2 smaller than 6, which is 4:  6-4 = 2.
     2) crisna receives 2. 2 is a power of 2. Hence, Player B divides 2 by 2 to get 1.
Since crisna reduced the number to 1, crisna is the winner.


input = 3
output =Shiva
	1) shiva starts. 3 is not a power of 2. 
	  Hence, shiva subtracts 3 by highest power of 2 smaller than 3, which is 2:  3-2 = 1
	so, Shiva wins.
