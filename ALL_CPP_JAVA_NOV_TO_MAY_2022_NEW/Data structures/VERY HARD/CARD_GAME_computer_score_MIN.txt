/*tinku is playing three card game with scores x,y and z with computer.
In each chance he choose 2 different non empty score cards,  subracts one point from the score and adds one point to computer score.

the game will stops when there are fewer than two non-empty cards(meaning there are no more subtraction possible).

Given three integers x, y and z , print maximum score computer can get.

example
input =2 4 6
output =6

x = 2, y = 4, z = 6

Explanation: The starting scores are (2, 4, 6). 

One optimal set of subtraction is:
- Take from 1st and 3rd cards, scores is now (1, 4, 5)
- Take from 1st and 3rd cards, scores is now (0, 4, 4)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd cards, scores is now (0, 3, 3)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd cards, scores is now (0, 2, 2)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd cards, scores is now (0, 1, 1)
- Take from 2nd and 3rd cards, scores is now (0, 0, 0)

There are fewer than two non-empty cards, so the game ends. so computer total score is : 6.



input =1 8 8
output =8

x = 1, y = 8, z = 8

Explanation: One optimal set of scores is to take from the 2nd and 3rd cards for 8 turns until they are empty.
After that, there are fewer than two non-empty cards, so the game ends. so computer will get score is 8 .
