[PENDING]
Steve is Designing a New email system.Where he wants to eliminate the gamil  based on few conditions. 

Every valid email consists of a local name and a domain name, in between '@'; 
For example, in "alice@gmail.com" , "alice" is the local name, and "gmail.com" is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, the email may contain one or more '.' or '+' .

If you add periods '.' between some characters in the local name part of an email address, mail sent there will be forwarded to
the same address without dots in the local name. 


For example, "alice.z@gmail.com" and "alicez@gmail.com" forward to the same email address.
If you add a plus '+' in the local name, everything after the first plus sign will be ignored. 
This allows certain emails to be eliminated.
This rule will not be applicable to  to domain names.


For example, "m.y+name@email.com" will be forwarded to "my@email.com" .
It is possible to use both of these rules at the same time.


Help Steve to solve the problem 
He will be given an group of email-ids where we send one email to each emails[i], return the number of different addresses that
actually receive mails.


Sample Test Case 
Input =test.email+alex@gmail.com  test.e.mail+bob.cathy@gmail.com  testemail+david@gm.ail.com
Output: 2

Explanation: "testemail@gmail.com" and "testemail@gm.ail.com" actually receive mails.


Example 2:
Input: emails =a@gmail.com b@gmail.com c@gmail.com
Output: 3

A Gold  merchant, announced an offer that they will charge the minimum price to make all the 
gold coins into one.

Customers who has different weights of gold coins wants to utilize the offer.

The processing charge to make two coins into one is calculated as follows:
	- To make two coins of weights A and B into one coin, 
	  you have to pay the amount 'A + B'. 

Your task is to help Gold Merchant to keep his promise and 
to charge the minimum amount to  gold coins
into one gold coin

Input Format:
-------------
Single line of space separated integers, number on the boxes.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, minimum amount to be paid by Customer


Sample Input-1:
---------------
4 3 6

Sample Output-1:
----------------
20


Sample Input-2:
---------------
5 2 4 3 6

Sample Output-2:
----------------
45

-----------------------------------------------------------

You are given a sequence A of N integers: A1,A2,A3... AN.

You would like to make all elements in A different.

To do so, you may perform operations 
of two types:

Remove an element. The cost of this operation is X coins.
Decrease the value of an element by one. The cost is Y coins.

You may perform as many operations as you wish.
It is possible and allowed that some elements will become negative
(after you decrease an element multiple times).

Your task is to find the minimum number of coins you would need in order to 
make A pairwise distinct.

Input Format
------------
The first line contains three space-separated integers N, X, and Y 
		— the size of the sequence and costs of operations.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1,A2,A3...AN
		— the initial sequence.

Output Format
-------------
Print one integer — the minimum number of coins needed to make A pairwise distinct.



Sample Input :
6 10 3
5 2 5 3 5 2

Sample Output :
16

Explanation :
we are given a sequence of size n=6.
The cost of removing and decreasing by one are 10 and 3 respectively.

The initial sequence is (5 2 5 3 5 2).
One optimal strategy is:

Remove one of three fives, e.g. the middle one. The remaining sequence is (5 2 3 5 2).
Decrease the second element by one, to get (5 1 3 5 2).
Decrease the first element by one, to get (4 1 3 5 2).
This way, you need to spend 10+3+3 =16 coins. 
The resulting sequence(4 1 3 5 2) is indeed pairwise distinct.

Sunder a Military Research Team wants to decode a message(A-1,B-2...Z-26). 
If Sunder is given a Number he wants to check in how many ways the number can be written into Characters. 

For Example - 123 can be assumed as 

ABC (A-1,B-2,C-3)  
AW  (A-1,W-23)
 LC    (L-12,C-3)

Total Ways are 3. He wants to write the code to get the number of ways . Help Sunder solve the problem.

Assume the Input number will be a valid word. 

For all Invalid Outputs print 0 

input = 100

There are N players, playing a game.

You are given the scores of the N players as scores[] array,
where i-th player score is score[i].

You are given P chances to modify the score of the players.

In each chance you can modify the score of i-th player as follows:
	- You are allowed increment the score of i-th player by 1.

You have to perform these increments, in order to maximize the occurances of any score.

Your task is to maximize occurances of a score, after utlizing atmost P chances.

Input Format:
-------------
First line of input consists of the scores followed by the number of chances(P)

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, maximum occurances of a score!


Input = 1 2 4 
5
Output = 3

Explanation: Increment the first score three times and the second score two times to make scores = [4,4,4].
4 has a maximum of 3 occurances



Example 2:
Input  = 1 4 8 13
5
Output: 2

Explanation: There are multiple optimal solutions:

- Increment the first score three times to make scores = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a maximum occurance of 2.
- Increment the second score four times to make scores = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a maximum occurance of 2.
- Increment the third score five times to make scores = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a maximum occurance of 2.

A Group of Monsters has few powers. 
The powers are represented in numbers both positive and negative. 
Each Member of the monster prays to get some power. 
God sanctions only one member of the Monster Group. 
The power can be performed only once on only one member of the monster. 
God will multipy the monster power with the same power. 
After  performing the above action, a sub-group of monsters check the power they have.
We have to now see which sub-group has the highest power. Print the Highest Sub-Power.


The first line of input contains the powers of the monsters. 

input = 4 -1 -5 -3
output = 28

The power operation is performed on the third monster, -5 * -5 which is 25 

Now the sub group with highest power is 4+(-1)+25 = 28

Scott a Third class is given the scores of the students. He is the leader of the class. 
His teachers calls him and asks him to call the nth smallest Score secured by the student. 
Help scott solve the problem. 

If no such thing exists print -1. 

input = 47912478
3
output = 4

in the above test case we have 4 as the third smallest score secured by the student.

input = 1111
2
output = -1

in the above test case we dont have any second smallest score secured by the student so output is -1


input = 100
1
output = 0

in the above test case we have 0 as the first smallest score by the student so the output is 0

The bomb grid is filled with danger values, with both positive and negative integers.
positive means you will lose power of grid[i][j], 
negative means you will gain power of grid[i][j].

Naresh wants to cross the bridge, with the minimum loss of power.
He can cross the grid in the following way:
	- He can start at any bomb cell in the first row.
	- He can step on the next bomb cell in the next row that 
	  is either directly below of the current cell or diagonally left/right. 
	- Specifically, the next bomb cell from position grid(i, j) will be grid(i+1,j-1),
	(i + 1, j) , or (i + 1, j + 1) .

Ragav is working with strings, which contain digits from [0-9] only.
he has to find if given string is a downgraded string or not.

A string is said to be a downgraded string, if the string follows the below rules:
	- Divide the string S into two or more substrings, like sub[0],sub[1], sub[2],..,sub[n-1]. 
	  If you append all the substrings should result in S,sub[0]+sub[1]+ sub[2]+..+sub[n-1] = S
	  
	- The numeric values of the substrings should be in decreasing order.
	  i.e., sub[0] > sub[1] > .. > sub[n-1].
	- The difference between each consecutive pair should be 1 only.
	  i.e., sub[0]-sub[1] = sub[1]-sub[2] = .. = sub[n-2]-sub[n-1] = 1.

Your task is to help Ragav to check the given numeric string is downgraded string or not.
