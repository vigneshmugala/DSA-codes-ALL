/*Soumika has a string S and its starting index is 1. 
The string S consists of characters from 1-9. As she is very intelligent, she wants to test his brother Vinay Tendulkar. 
She asked her brother Vinay Tendulkar to count the number of even numbered characters ( i.e 2,4,6,8 ) for every index i

For an index i, the result should be calculated from i to the end of the string. 

As Vinay doesn't know about programming, he wants you to help him find the solution.

Input:
First line contains a string S.

Output:
Print |S| space-separated integers,the result of every index.

Sample Input :
574674546476

Sample Output :
7 7 7 6 5 5 4 4 3 2 1 1

Explanation :

Given string S is .
for index 1
Number of even numbers from 5 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 1 is 7.
for index 2
Number of even numbers from 7 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 2 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 4 to end of the string is 7 so the result of index 3 is 7.
for index 3
Number of even numbers from 6 to end of the string is 6 so the result of index 4 is 6.....

ex:2
input=64646442
output=8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
