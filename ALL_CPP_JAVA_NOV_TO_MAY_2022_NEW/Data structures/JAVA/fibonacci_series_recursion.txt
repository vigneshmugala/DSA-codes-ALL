/* Write a java program to Create a recursive function that, takes a number, 
returns the corresponding value of that index in the Fibonacci series.

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding the two numbers before it:

The 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1).
The 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2).
The 5 is (2+3), and so on!
Example input/output
3      3

7      21

12      //input
233     //output
Notes
The first number in the sequence starts at 1 (not 0).
