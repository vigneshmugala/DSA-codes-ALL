/* Two friends of class 10 are playing a game. 
Rules for that game: 
one of the two would come forward and say a word (smallcased string)
another one should convert that word into numaric list and say

for example F1 says     eabd
opponent must reply with [0, 1, 2, 3]

example2
baa
[0, 1, 1]

Explanation: opponent said word have four characters starting character is mapped with zero (0)
and upcomming distinct characters are increased by one (1)
if duplicate characters are there in such cases need to use same numaric value which is already used.
as like example2 a is repeating 2 times so for all occrences use same integer map.

help these friends to develop a program that makes any individual can play with computer.

Notes
->Start the counter at 0, and increment by 1 each time if encounter a new character.
->Identical characters should share the same number.
-> do consider character sequence of string
