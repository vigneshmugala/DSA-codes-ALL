/* It seems like the year of 2013. Do you know a curious fact? 
The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.

Now you are suggested to solve the following problem by writing a java program: 
given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than 
the given one and has only distinct digits.

Input
The single line contains integer y (1000<= y <=9000) — the year number.

Output
Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than y and all it's
digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.

Sample input/output
input=1987
output=2013

input=2013
output=2014
